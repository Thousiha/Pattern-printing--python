Strategies & Techniques for Pattern Programming
Understanding Loop Structure

Outer Loop → Controls rows.
Inner Loop → Controls columns (characters per row).
Conditions → Used to modify spaces, alignment, or specific prints.
Using Nested Loops

Typically, for loops (or while loops) help in managing rows and columns.
Managing Spaces for Alignment

print(" ", end="") for spaces before characters.
Right-angled, pyramid, or diamond patterns use spaces for symmetry.
Incrementing/Decrementing Values

Numbers/alphabet values change in a structured way.
Use chr(ASCII_value) for alphabetic patterns.
Mirroring & Symmetry

Some patterns are mirror images, requiring two loops to print left and right halves.
Using Conditional Statements

if-else can be used to print specific elements in hollow, zigzag, or diamond patterns.
